# Acnicoy

Acnicoy is a tool for learning Japanese (and other languages) which implements
a [Spaced Repetition System][SRS] (SRS) for memorizing Vocabulary.
While the basic features work for every language, the program offers a bunch of
additional features specifically for learning Japanese.

Features
----

The basic features for every language include:

* Create and manage your own vocabulary
* Organize similar parts of the vocabulary into lists
* Test yourself on the vocabulary using spaced repetition
* View statistics illustrating your progress

For Japanese language learners, the program additionally offers:

* Create and manage a kanji vocabulary
* More stats illustrating your kanji learning progress
* Look up words in the dictionary (similar to [Jisho] and [Houhou SRS])
* Kanji overview and cleanly presented kanji information

Features to be implemented:

* Earn achievements for learning progress and unlock design settings
* Many settings to customize design, kanji overview, SRS system, and more
* ... (the todo-list is fairly large)

Installation
----

**NOTE**: The program is still missing a bunch of features and it's not fully
stable, so there's no release yet. You can build it from source instead, as
described below.

### Building from source
Acnicoy requires [Node.js] v5+ to run and uses the [npm package manager][npm].
To get started, run:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/phxstick/acnicoy
$ make install
$ make build
```

License

I'm not well versed with licensing. I guess I can just leave this empty for now.
So I guess it's copyrighted until I decide on a proper open-source license.
