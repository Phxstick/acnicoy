# Acnicoy

Acnicoy is a  tool for learning Japanese (and other languages) which implements a [Spaced Repetition System][SRS] (SRS) for memorizing Vocabulary.
While the basic features work for every language, the program offers a bunch of additional features specifically for learning Japanese.

  - Create and manage your own vocabulary
  - Organize similar parts of the vocabulary into lists
  - Test yourself on the vocabulary using spaced repetition
  - View statistics illustrating your progress

For Japanese language learners, the program additionally offers:
  - Create and manage a kanji vocabulary
  - More stats illustrating your kanji learning progress
  - Look up words in the dictionary (similar to [Jisho] and [Houhou SRS])
  - Customizable kanji overview and cleanly presented kanji information

Features to be implemented:
  - Color schemes for customizing design
  - Earn achievements for your learning progress and unlock design settings
