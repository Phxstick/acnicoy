You can add words/sentences to your vocabulary by pressing the topmost button on the sidebar. This opens a pane where you can enter the word, a list of translations and choose vocabulary lists the word should be added to.

You can also choose an SRS level by pressing the red square, which will display all levels in the scheme selected for the active language. Hovering over a level displays the corresponding time interval.

When you start typing the name of a vocabulary list, the auto-completion feature will show the names of all existing lists containing the typed text. You can click an existing list to choose it, or keep typing to create a new list.

Since adding words is one of the most frequent procedures, it's advised to use shortcuts for it:

- Press **tab** to jump between sections in the pane. Hold shift while pressing tab to jump backwards.
- When adding multiple translations, type a **semicolon** (";") or press **enter** to finalize the currently typed translation and add a new one.
- When picking a vocab list, use the up & down **arrow keys** to move the selection and press **enter** to choose the selected list.
- Press **ctrl + a number** between 1 and 9 to select a fitting SRS level (1 by default).
- Press **ctrl + enter** to finally add the word along with all the entered details.
