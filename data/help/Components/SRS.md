Spaced repetition is a strategy to achieve long-term memorization of vocabulary items with minimal effort. The idea is to gradually increase the time interval between reviews of vocabulary items that the learner remembers well, and decrease it for items that have been forgotten. Using this strategy, items that the learner remembers well won't be brought up unnecessarily often, while items that the learner struggles with will appear more frequently.

In order to implement such a spaced repetition system (SRS), every vocabulary item is assigned to a level. Each level has an associated time interval, which determines when the item will reappear for the next review. After an item has been reviewed, it moves to another level depending on the given answer. If the answer was correct, it will move up one level, otherwise it moves down one level.
