Notes are useful to write down things about the language you're learning, such
as grammar rules or peculiarities, or to keep lists with language learning
resources. They can be accessed by clicking the "Notes" button on the sidebar.

### Managing groups

Notes are organized into groups and subgroups, which are displayed on the left.
The groups can be browsed and manipulated in a similar way that common file
managers let you do with the file system:

- Click a group to display its contents.
- Click the arrow to the left of the group name to show/hide subgroups.
- Right-clicking a group opens a context menu with the options to delete the
  group, rename it, or add a new subgroup.
- Right-clicking anywhere gives you the option to create a new top-level group.

### Managing notes

The notes in the currently selected group are displayed in the right part of the
screen. To add a new note to this group, click the button on the top, type in
the desired text, and press `Ctrl + Enter` or `Escape` to save the changes.

There are three things you can do with already existing notes:

- **Editing**: double-click the note, or right-click and select "Edit note".
- **Removing**: right-click and select "Remove note".
- **Moving**: Press `Ctrl` and start dragging. You can reorder notes within the
  a group by dropping them above other notes (a red line indicates where they
  will be moved to), and move notes to another group by dropping them on the
  name of that group.
