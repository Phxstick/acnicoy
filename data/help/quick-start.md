[Take the visual tour](tour#main-window)

Acnicoy aims to help with learning a language by providing features such as
spaced repetition and vocabulary lists.

The sidebar on the left of the window provides functions that operate on the
currently selected language. You build up a vocabulary using the "Word" button
at the top, which lets you enter foreign words along with their translations.

Acnicoy will schedule your vocabulary items for review according to a
customizable [spaced repetition system](help#Components#SRS). To test yourself
on those items, click the "Test" button on the side bar (which displays the
amount of items that are ready to be reviewed).

If you are learning several languages, you can switch to another language
by clicking the button located in the top left corner of the window.
You can access additional features by clicking the buttons next to it:

<ul class="fa-ul" style="padding-left: 0">
<li><i class="fa fa-home fa-li"></i> Get an overview of the status of your vocabulary items in the spaced repetition system</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-bar-chart fa-li"></i> View statistics of your learning progress</li>
<li><i class="fa fa-gear fa-li"></i> Customize the program using various settings</li>
</ul>
