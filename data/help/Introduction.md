Acnicoy is an application which aims to improve the process of learning a language
by providing features such as spaced repetition, vocabulary lists and statistics.

This help is split into three parts:
- **[Quick Start](#Quick Start)**: If you aren't up to reading boring detailed descriptions
  and just want to start learning, this section will give you a broad overview of the most
  important parts of the application.
- **[Components](#Components)**: More detailed descriptions of each of the components.
- **[Languages](#Languages)**: Acnicoy can be used for learning any language, because the
  core features work independent of specific languages. For some languages however, there
  are additional features available, which are described in this section.
