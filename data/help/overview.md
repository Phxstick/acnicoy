This help section is split into three parts:

- [Quick Start](help#Quick_Start): If you aren't up to reading boring
  descriptions and just want to start learning, this section will give you a
  broad overview of the most important parts of the application.
- [Components](help#Components): More detailed descriptions for each of the
  components. The interface has been designed carefully such that most
  components should be intuitively comprehensible, so you might never have
  to read this.
- [Languages](help#Languages): Acnicoy can be used for learning any language,
  because the core features work independently of specific languages.
  For some languages however, there are additional features available, which
  are described in this section.
