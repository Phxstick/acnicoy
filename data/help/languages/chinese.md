In addition to the word vocabulary, there is also a vocabulary for hanzi. In
order to add hanzi to your hanzi vocabulary, you can use the "Add hanzi" button
on the side bar.

In all places where pinyin must be entered (e.g. when adding a hanzi to the
vocabulary), the input field converts syllables with a following number
(1 to 4) to syllables with the corresponding tone marks. For example, the text
"zhong1guo2" becomes "zhōngguó" when entered into a pinyin input field.
