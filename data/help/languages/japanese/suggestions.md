When adding words or kanji from the dictionary, information on the selected
dictionary entry will appear on the right side of the screen.

You can left-click any of the displayed translations or readings to add them
to your vocabulary item, and right-click to remove them. You can also click
a section header to add all corresponding items, i.e. clicking the header
"translations" will select all available translations, and clicking "readings"
will select all readings. Again, right-clicking will deselect instead.

If a word has multiple associated meanings, they will be shown in numbered rows.
Clicking a number will select/deselect all translations for the corresponding
meaning.

For some words, there exist multiple variants of how they're written. You can
only select one of these variants. Note that the available translations and
readings can slightly differ between variants.
