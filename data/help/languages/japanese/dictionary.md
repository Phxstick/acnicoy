If you have language data for Japanese installed, a button to open the
dictionary will appear in the side bar. You can also open it using a shortcut,
which is `Ctrl+F` by default.

You can search for words by directly entering a word or its reading into the
first search entry, or by entering translations of the sought word
into the second search entry. Asterisks in the query function as wildcards
that can match an arbitrary number of characters. By default, queries are
interpreted with a wildcard at the end, which will match all words starting
with the entered character sequence. Exact matches are always shown first.

You can adjust search settings or view your search history by clicking the
buttons on the right of the search bars.

Note that you can always click any kanji appearing in the words in order to
display information on that kanji. You can also click any translation or word
reading to search for other words matching them.
