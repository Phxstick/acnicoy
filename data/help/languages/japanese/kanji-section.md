If you have language data for Japanese installed, a button to open the kanji
section will appear in the side bar. You can also open it using a shortcut,
which is `Shift+Ctrl+F` by default.

This section contains a customizable kanji overview, where kanji can be split
into groups by criteria such as grade or stroke number. You can also enter
queries into the search bar at the top to find the kanji you're looking for.

You can open the customization panel or switch from the search results to the
overview using the buttons on the right of the search bar.
