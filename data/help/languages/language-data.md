You can download additional data for specific languages in the language
settings. Currently, such data is only available for Japanese and Chinese.

Downloaded language data will automatically get loaded as soon as it's needed.
There's also the option to load all language data on program launch (can
be toggled in the general settings). This will make sure that data is always
ready, but increases startup time.

You will receive notifications when new or updated language data for one of
your registered languages becomes available for download.
