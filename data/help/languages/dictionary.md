After downloading language data, you will get access to a dictionary that can be
opened by clicking the button on the side bar or pressing `Ctrl+F`.

### Search queries

You can search for words by directly entering a word into the search field
on the left, or by entering their translations (or parts thereof) into the
search field on the right. For Japanese and Chinese, you can also search for
words by their reading.

Asterisks in the query function as wildcards that can match an arbitrary number
of characters. By default, queries are interpreted with a wildcard at the end,
which will match all words starting with the entered character sequence. Exact
matches are always shown first.

Note that you can click any translation to start a search for it. In case
of Japanese and Chinese, you can also start a search for any of the readings,
and click any character appearing in the words to view information about it.

### Search suggestions

When adding words from the dictionary, information on the selected dictionary
entry will appear on the right side of the screen.

You can left-click any of the displayed translations or readings to add them
to your vocabulary item, and right-click to remove them. You can also click
a section header to add all corresponding items, i.e. clicking the header
"translations" will select all available translations, and clicking "readings"
will select all readings. Again, right-clicking will deselect instead.

If a word has multiple associated meanings, they will be shown in numbered rows.
Clicking a number will select/deselect all translations for the corresponding
meaning.

For some words, there exist multiple variants of how they're written. You can
only select one of these variants. Note that the available translations and
readings can slightly differ between variants.
