Japanese is the primarily supported language in Acnicoy. In order to be able to
use all the available features (such as the [dictionary](help#Languages#Japanese#Dictionary)),
make sure you always have the latest data installed, which can be done in the
language settings.

In addition to the word vocabulary, there is also a vocabulary for kanji. In
order to add kanji to your kanji vocabulary, you can use the "Add kanji" button
on the side bar, or select a kanji in the [kanji section](help#Languages#Japanese#Kanji_section).

In all places where hiragana or katakana need to be entered (e.g. when adding
kun-yomi or on-yomi to a kanji), the input field converts typed text into
hiragana or katakana (type while pressing `shift` to switch to the other).

If language data is installed, you can also make use of the following features:

- [Dictionary](help#Languages#Japanese#Dictionary)
- [Kanji Section](help#Languages#Japanese#Kanji_section)
