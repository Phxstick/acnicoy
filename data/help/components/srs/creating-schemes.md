You can create your own SRS schemes, which specify the time intervals between reviews of a vocabulary item. To do so, head to the language settings and press the "Edit SRS schemes" button.

The available schemes are listed on the left side of the window. Selecting a scheme displays its details on the right side, i.e. a description, the levels and associated intervals. The three buttons on the top right can be used to edit,duplicate or remove the selected scheme.

A time interval can be specified using natural language, e.g. "5 days" or "1 year". Multiple units must be separated by a comma, e.g. like this: "1 month, 2 weeks, 10 days, 5 hours".
