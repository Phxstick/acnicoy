Pressing the "test" button in the middle of the sidebar on the left will allow
you to test yourself on the vocabulary items you have previously added. The
program will automatically schedule items for review according to the chosen
SRS scheme for this language, which can be changed in the language settings.

The items that are ready for review will by default appear in a random order.
It is possible to give precedence to items in lower SRS levels by marking the
corresponding checkbox in the test settings.

### Test modes

There are two modes for reviewing vocabulary items, **typing mode** and **flashcard
mode**. The former is used by default, but you can also switch to the latter by
marking the corresponding checkbox in the test settings. See the following
subsections for details on each mode:

- [Typing mode](help#Components#Reviewing#Typing_mode)
- [Flashcard mode](help#Components#Reviewing#Flashcard_mode)
