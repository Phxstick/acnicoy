Pressing the "test" button in the middle of the sidebar on the left will allow
you to test yourself on the vocabulary items you have previously added. The
program will automatically schedule items for review according to the chosen
SRS scheme for this language, which can be changed in the language settings.

The items that are ready for review will by default appear in a random order.
It is possible to give precedence to items with lower SRS levels by marking the
corresponding checkbox in the test settings.

### Test modes
There are two modes for testing yourself on the vocabulary: *typing mode* and
*flashcard mode*. The former is used by default, but you can also switch to the
latter by marking the corresponding checkbox in the test settings.

#### Typing mode
Given a question, you can type your answer into the text field and press the enter
key when you're done. The program will then automatically match your answer to
the registered solutions, and deem your answer as correct it matches one of them
(small typos are ignored, as long as they're not too many). The program will
then tell you whether your answer was correct and display all the solutions.

Now, you have the possibility to edit the shown vocabulary entry and control
how your answer will be counted, using the four displayed controls:

- **Ignore answer**: pressing this button will make your answer not count, and
  continue as if nothing happened. The question will then reappar again later.  
  This is can be useful if e.g. your answer was wrongly deemed as incorrect
  because of too many typos, or if you didn't pay attention and happened to have
  misread the question.  
  A keyboard shortcut for this action can be set up in the test settings.

- **Add answer to item**: pressing this button will register your answer as a
  new solution for this question. This can be useful to quickly add a synonym
  or a rephrased version of a solution.

- **Modify item**: pressing this button will open a pane where you can edit
  the vocabulary item from the question. This can be useful to fix errors in
  the registered solutions.

- The current **SRS level** of the item, as well as the level it will be moved
  to, are displayed on the right side of the screen. You can click this to
  manually select the new level for the item.  
  If you had trouble answering the question, you can choose a low level to see
  it again earlier. If you feel very confident with this item, you can also
  move it to a higher level.

Press "continue" to move the item to the chosen level and continue to the next
question. There is also the possibility to immediately continue to the next
item after a correct answer, which can be enabled by marking the corresponding
checkbox in the test settings.

#### Flashcard mode
Given a question, you can think about the answer and press a button when you're
ready to see the solutions. If you believe that your answer matches the shown
solutions sufficiently, press the "Correct" button to advance the item to the
next level, otherwise press the "Wrong" button to demote it by one level.

This mode is useful if you want to save time by skipping the typing. On the
other hand, it can be tempting to count an answer as correct even though the
answer you had in mind might not have been completely fitting.
