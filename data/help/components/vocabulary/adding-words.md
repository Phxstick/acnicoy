You can add words/sentences to your vocabulary by pressing the topmost button on the sidebar. This opens a pane where you can enter the word, a list of translations, and optionally readings (if the function is activated for the selected language). Each vocabulary entry must have at least one translation or reading, since these values will be prompted during review sessions.

Additionally, you can choose to add the entry to one or more vocabulary lists,
or write arbitrary notes which will be shown during review sessions after
correctly answering an item (if both translations and readings have been added,
both must be answered correctly before notes are displayed).

When you start typing the name of a vocabulary list, the auto-completion feature will show the names of all existing lists containing the typed text. You can click an existing list to choose it, or keep typing to create a new list.

You can choose the initial SRS level for the entry by pressing the square on the top right, which will display all levels in the scheme selected for the active language. Hovering over a level displays the corresponding time interval.

Since adding words is one of the most frequent procedures, it's advised to use shortcuts for it:

- Press **tab** to jump between sections in the pane. Hold shift while pressing tab to jump backwards.
- When adding multiple translations, type a **semicolon** (";") or press **enter** to finalize the currently typed translation and add a new one.
- When picking a vocab list, use the up & down **arrow keys** to move the selection and press **enter** to choose the selected list.
- Press **ctrl + [number]** between 1 and 9 to select a fitting SRS level (1 by default).
- Press **ctrl + enter** to finally add the word along with all the entered details.
