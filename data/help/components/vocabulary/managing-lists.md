Press the "vocab" button on the side bar to manage your vocabulary.

The words in your vocabulary are displayed in the left colum. Clicking a word opens a pane that displays its details and allows you to make changes. Words are greyed out if they are already added to at least one vocabulary list.

The names of your vocabulary lists are displayed in the middle column. Click a list name to have its contents displayed in the right column. You can press the buttons at the bottom to add a new list, or rename/delete the selected one. You can also test yourself on the selected list (this will not make any changes to the SRS levels of reviewed items).

You can add a word to a list by dragging it on the name of the corresponding list in the middle column. You can also drop it above the right column to add it to the currently selected list.

You can select/deselect multiple vocabulary items by clicking them while
pressing Ctrl, or select whole ranges by pressing shift. Dragging one of the
selected items will then move all of them to a vocabulary list. You can also
select multiple vocabulary lists to test yourself on all of them at once.
