Given a question, you can type your answer into the text field and press the
enter key when you're done. The program will then automatically match your
answer to the registered solutions, and deem your answer correct if it matches
one of them.

If your solutions contain information in round or square brackets, you may omit
it in your answer. When entering translations (but not readings), small typos
are also ignored, as long as they're not too many. The program will tell you
whether your answer was considered correct and display all the registered
solutions.

Now, you have the chance to edit the shown vocabulary entry and control
how your answer will be counted, using the four displayed controls:

- **Ignore answer**: pressing this button will make your answer not count, and
  continue as if nothing happened. The question will then reappear again later.  
  This is can be useful if e.g. your answer was wrongly deemed as incorrect
  because of too many typos, or if you didn't pay attention and happened to have
  misread the question.  

- **Add solution**: pressing this button will register your answer as a
  new solution for the question. This can be useful to quickly add a synonym
  or a rephrased version of a solution.

- **Modify item**: pressing this button will open a pane where you can edit
  the vocabulary item from the question. This can be useful to fix errors in
  the registered solutions.

- The current **SRS level** of the item, as well as the level it will be moved
  to, are displayed on the right side of the screen. You can click this to
  manually select the new level for the item.  
  If you had trouble answering the question, you can choose a low level to see
  it again earlier. If you feel very confident with this item, you can also
  move it to a higher level.

Shortcuts are assigned to each of these controls, which can be viewed and
changed in the settings.

Press "continue" to move the item to the chosen level and move on to the next
question. There is also the option to immediately continue to the next item
after a correct answer, which can be enabled by marking the corresponding
checkbox in the test settings.
