Given a question, you can think about the answer and press a button when you're
ready to see the solutions. If you believe that your answer matches the shown
solutions sufficiently, press the "Correct" button to advance the item to the
next level, otherwise press the "Wrong" button to demote it by one level.

Below these buttons, all levels in the active SRS scheme are displayed. The
level the item would be moved to in case you decide to count your answer as
incorrect is colored in red. The level it would be moved to if counted as
correct is marked green. Click one of the numbers or use the corresponding
shortcut to manually select the next level.

Flashcard mode can be useful if you want to save time by skipping the typing,
or if translations can be rephrased in many ways so that automatic matching
becomes impractical.

On the other hand, it can be tempting to count an answer as correct even though
the answer you had in mind might have been a bit off. Choosing flashcard mode
is therefore only recommended if you can truthfully judge your own mistakes.
