Given a question, you can think about the answer and click a button (or press
**space bar**) when you're ready to see the solutions. If you believe that your
answer matches the shown solutions sufficiently, click the "Right" button (or
press **R**) to count it as correct, otherwise click the "Wrong" button (or
press **W**) to count it as incorrect.

You can also assign custom shortcuts to these two actions, but the defaults are
recommended as they can all be utilized comfortably with a single hand.

Below these buttons, all levels in the active SRS scheme are displayed. The
level the item would be moved to in case you decide to count your answer as
incorrect is colored in red. The level it would be moved to if counted as
correct is marked green. Click one of the numbers or use the corresponding
shortcut (Ctrl + number) to manually select the next level.

Note that an item will be demoted if at least one part of it (translations or
readings) was answered incorrectly. In that case, only a red marker will be
displayed and the item will move down a level regardless of whether the next
part was answered correctly. If you still wish to move it up, you can manually
select a new level.

Flashcard mode can be useful if you want to save time by skipping the typing,
or if translations can be rephrased in many ways so that automatic matching
becomes impractical.

On the other hand, it can be tempting to count an answer as correct even though
the answer you had in mind might have been a bit off. Choosing flashcard mode
is therefore only recommended if you can truthfully judge your own mistakes.
