The home screen gives you an overview of the status of your vocabulary items in
the spaced repetition system. The displayed information is updated regularly
every five minutes, but you can also refresh it manually by pressing Ctrl + R.

The table at the top displays the distribution of items across SRS levels for
each language. Small grey numbers denote the total number of items in a level,
whereas large red numbers below denote the number of items ready for review.

If you're short on time, it's recommended to at least review items in lower SRS
levels, as these are more likely to slip out of your memory if neglected. You
can enable prioritization of low-level items in the test settings.

The bar diagram at the bottom shows the amount of items that are scheduled for
review in intervals in the near future. The timeline can be dragged to reveal
more of the schedule up to a limit.
