Acnicoy is an application which aims to help in the process of learning a
language by providing features such as spaced repetition, vocabulary lists and
statistics.

The most important features that are frequently used are accessible from the
sidebar on the left of the window.

Basically, you build up a vocabulary by clicking the "Add word" button and
entering foreign words or sentences along with their translations.
Acnicoy will periodically schedule your vocabulary items for review according
to a customizable [SRS system](#Components#SRS). To test yourself on those
items, click the "Test" button (which displays the amount of items which are
ready to be reviewed for the currently selected language).

If you are learning several languages, you can switch your current language
by clicking the language label located at the top left of the window.
You can access additional features by clicking the buttons next to the label,
such as:

- view your vocabulary and organize it into lists
- view statistics of your learning progress
- customize the program using various settings

For additional information on certain [components](#Components) or
[language support](#Languages), you can open the [help](#Overview) by clicking
the help button at the bottom of the side bar.
