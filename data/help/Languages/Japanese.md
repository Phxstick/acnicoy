Japanese is the primarily supported language in Acnicoy. In order to be able to
use all the features (such as the dictionary), make sure you always have the
latest version of the [content data](help#Settings#Languages) installed.

In addition to the word vocabulary, there is also a vocabulary for kanji. In
order to add kanji to your kanji vocabulary, you can use the "Add kanji" button
on the side bar, or select a kanji in the [kanji section](help#Languages#Japanese#Kanji section).

In all places where hiragana or katakana need to be written (e.g. when adding
kun-yomi or on-yomi to a kanji in the vocabulary), the input field converts
typed text into hiragana or katakana (type while pressing `shift` to switch
between hiragana and katakana).

### Dictionary

If you have the latest version of language content for Japanese installed, a
button to open the dictionary will appear in the side bar (you can also open
it with a shortcut, which is `Ctrl+F` by default).
You can search for words by directly entering a word or its reading (in kana)
into the first search entry, or by entering translations of the sought word
into the second search entry.

You can adjust search settings or view your search history by clicking the
buttons on the right of the search bars.

Note that you can always click any kanji appearing in the words in order to
display information on that kanji.

### Kanji section

If you have the latest version of language content for Japanese installed, a
button to open the kanji section will appear in the side bar.

This section contains a customizable kanji overview, where kanji can be split
into groups by radical, stroke number, grade, etc.. You can also enter
queries into the search bar at the top to find the kanji you're looking for.

You can open the customization panel or switch between the overview and search
results using the buttons on the right of the search bar. You can also switch
using shortcuts, by default `Ctrl+Shift+F` for the search and `Ctrl+O` for the
overview.
