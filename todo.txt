TODO next:
- Adapt remaining sections
- Adapt index.js correctly
- Make sections wait until all content has loaded?
==> Test and commit

__ BUGFIXES __
- Use different random generator? Seed always generates about same sequence?
- Make sure Japanese-only stuff is closed when changing to other language
- Make edit panel inputs unpack when clicking somewhere else
- Issue with database modification speed? Or is it the JS overhead afterwards?
- Replace added-button in opened kanji-info-panel if kanji has been added
- details bar in kanji info panel does not wrap at all or incorrectly.
- info in details bar should properly be compressed if there are many readings
  or meanings
- Use utility.finishEventQueue where sizes are not returned correctly!!

__ Fundamentals (Data) __
- [Consider overhaul of data storage --> Primarily use IDs for words?]
- [Consider making kanji-modes into one with 2 to 3 parts for each kanji]
  ( --> Very problematic for partly added kanji)
- Add additional field to kanjiData database for "hidden acceptable meanings",
  containg synonyms or words with similar meaning
  --> Show option in test settings to turn hidden meanings on or off
  --> Allow displaying hidden meanings in kanji info

__ General __
- Find dictionary of monolingual descriptions (display in test after answer?)
- Create a proper pointer cursor. Create better normal cursor as well
- Add icons to the left of status message aswell?
- Find a way to implement loading screen, then add loading animation
- Also use border gradients for shadowing
- Allow temporary entries to be closed by clicking anywhere else
- Differentiate between dark button and light button?
- Where to put all the tons of update logic from eventEmitters?
- Make popupstack have expandable shadow when popping up to see borders clearly
- Show interval time when hovering above SRS level somewhere
- If there's no content for a language, make contentLoaded-promise return error?
- Possible trainer name: Acnicoy
- Display srs counts for each language in language popup panel
  --> Requires restructuring of dataManager...?
- Make overlay window widget for init/help section.
- Use inset shadows and class animations to design switch-buttons!
- Use new version of custom elements (See resources)
- For the time being, implement a little vocabulary backup system in order
  to not do this manually anymore.
- Updgrade electron to latest version (1.35) and check out new features?
- Have one global popupmenu object (so that only one is always active)
- Allow filling popupmenu with an array of options (allows storing configs)
- Make language content optional and provide language packs for download?
- Check if there is something selected and adjust popupwindow for copying etc.
  --> Make other copy options more detailed, e.g. "Copy kanji", "Copy word"
- Remove "data" from content section and always access with "dataMap[...]"?

__ Code __
- Also split js and css into sections/widgets/panels?
- Use CSS variables for all widget styling
- Replace .button with actual button element (both in css and html)
- Stop using things like 110% font everywhere - Use as standard font size in
  _base file instead or in some classes there
- Make file with all z-index layers of the program
- Put font-awesome import in _base scss?
- Don't change event listeners in converter.js but change callback var instead?
- Put common code for panels in _panel.scss file and import everywhere?
- Put common panel code in TrainerPanel class and inherit everywhere?
- Remove inconsistencies in code, e.g. unify glossary ("word" <-> "entry")
- Make special function where all update logic is defined to keep code clean?
- Rewrite all sections like history section so that custom elements work
- Rework edit-vocab-panel like edit-kanji-panel (only one function call for
  all the changes, everything logged in dataManager.vocab.editWord)!
--> Especially logging should be done by the datamanger since it's triggered
    by data changes and doesn't depend on the interface!!
- Try to generalize as much scss as possibly and extend _base file.
  Split parts of _base file into smaller parts.

__ Init section __
- Open if dataPath in settings is empty
  => Require setting a data path then (use electrons file dialog here)
  => If data is found at fiven path, return, otherwise proceed to set first lang
- Have second part of init section to set first language
  => Also open if directory in dataPath is empty

__ Home section __
- When vocabulary is empty, write very small manual info card into intro section
- When vocabulary is not empty, display SRS table
- Create SRS bar diagram for more visual and quick information?
- Allow collapsing columns in SRS table (--> No partitioning by modes)
- Make changelog widget for pinwall
- Make widget-adder a widget aswell (only movable then)?
- Display adder-widget only when ctrl is pressed with cursor above section?
- Customizable bar diagram showing when new items for testing become available

__ Popup-Menu __
- Make width of popupmenu the width of largest item?

__ Test __
- Also construct extended solutions in _createTest already ?
- Properly handle overflow if correct-answer-frame gets too large
  --> Try to fade out items at bottom if list is too large,
      remove fading when bottom reached
- Possibly round up appearance time to e.g. 15 minutes
  ==> New stuff appears in batches, and a counter can be shown in intro section
- Write changed db entries async in small intervals to prevent data loss
- Show where the entry goes
- Animate everything (and have setting to to toggle that)
- Have invisible translations for synonyms/unnecessary words (e.g. AE <-> BE)

__ Kanji __
- Use bottom-animation to slide open kanji info panel (better performance)?
- Use selection colors when hovering over added kanji?
- Make add-kanji button in a brighter color (less distracting)?
- Possibly make mapping from kanji parts to actual parts in SVG drawing
  to make sure all parts are properly highlighted
- Show info for kanji that are part of the Chinese zodiac
- Show info for kanji that symbolize a country

__ Content __
- Contains a database of custom info cards
- Allow uploading and sharing vocabulary lists
- Offer small coding environment for creating cards with HTML/CSS/JS

__ Edit vocab panel __
- Remove lists from select element where the word is already in?
  (How to do this most efficiently?)

__ Edit vocab panel __
- Create dataManager.kanji.add function for this

__ Vocab __
- Allow testing oneself on vocabulary lists (add test button in the section)
- Make sure changes to vocab lists are reflected in add vocab panel (events!)

__ Svg Bar Diagram __
- Terminology: Descriptions/Labels??

__ History __
- Completely rework history section?
  --> Only display added entries and kanji?

__ Stats/Achievements __
- Use single-bar diagram for kanji progress to display relative to total!
- Display earned achievement in status bar and make it glow golden to highlight
- Daily stats diagrams below the general stats, next to each other
    --> One for mastery points, one for new vocab/kanji added
    --> Allow displaying daily and cumulative progress for each daigram
    --> Also color each bar in two colors according to kanji and vocab progress
- Bar diagrams showing kanji learned by grade and JLPT next to each other
- Update at least general stats when words/kanji are added
