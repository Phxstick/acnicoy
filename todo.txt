___ Future ____________________________________________________________________

- Consider making kanji-modes into single one with 2-3 parts for each kanji
  --> Very problematic for partly added kanji
  --> Would allow more stylish and compact mode presentation
  --> Would allow easier synchronization with Houhou SRS trainer
- Find monolingual dictionary for Japanese
- Add additional field to kanjiData database for "hidden acceptable meanings",
  containg synonyms or words with very similar meaning?
  --> Show option in test settings to turn hidden meanings on or off
  --> Allow displaying hidden meanings in kanji info
- Have invisible translations for synonyms/unnecessary words (e.g. AE <-> BE)

- Proper focus system with frames and elements for tabbing

- Restructuring: Separate core functionality from language extensions
  --> Provide interface for extensions, e.g.:
      --> "addMenuButton(label, callback)" for main-section extensions
      --> "addStatistic(element)" for stats-section extensions
  --> Use ES6 proxies for data modules

content-section:
- Contains a database of custom info cards
- Allow uploading and sharing vocabulary lists
- Offer small coding environment for creating cards with HTML/CSS/JS

- https://webkit.org/blog/4096/introducing-shadow-dom-api/
- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
  --> Basically very powerful 2D-flexboxes
- Use selection API  (window.getSelection(), selectionstart, selectionchanged)
  (http://caniuse.com/#feat=selection-api)
- Use native DOM manipulation convenience methods 
  (http://caniuse.com/#feat=dom-manip-convenience)
- Use Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()
  (http://caniuse.com/#feat=scrollintoviewifneeded)
- http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-focus-within

  native code written in languages like C or C++. The code is executed in a
  sandbox for security, and it runs at almost-native speeds --> Nice
