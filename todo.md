    tooltips/context-menu/kanji-info-links)
  - Call garbage collector after unloading language data to actually unload it?
  - Remove example-words-index?

- Make searching for vocab lists faster by pre-sorting in datamanger already?
- Make history view loading more efficient
- Limit size of search history to a sensible value

  Or otherwise indicate which section/panel is currently opened?
- Notifications:
  - Add buttons to remove a notification or all of them?

- Also make files for improved on/kun-yomi (or rather put in same file?)
- Check if there is new stuff in the JMdict that's not getting parsed yet
- Get rid of words column in dictionary table? (adjust both parse and JS-script)
  Note that this might require to create words-index again, probably not worth.
- Consider dropping name-dictionary to lower memory usage and file size
  - Maybe include it in the data but only load it when explicitly asked to

### Kanji Info Panel

- Also prioritize common words not part of the frequency lists?
  (marked with "spec1/2" in JMdict.xml)
- Implement tags/options to customize word/name search
- In content/database-module, switch query/run-method to one ignoring errors?
- Use separate where-clause for each (space-separated?) word in the query
- Refined okurigana mapping, such that e.g. searching "作hin" gives "作品"
- Devise a ranking for name search result, if possible find name frequencies

Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Naming
- Rename panels into "panes" or "sliding-panes"?
- Use folder "widgets" only for base widgets, put everything else directly into
  a folder called "gui-components"
  - Adjust pathManager and index.js
- Rename "Windows" to "Screens"?
- Starting to get collisions with classes defined in base.scss. Prefix them...

### Refactoring
- Move stuff in settings subsections into a settings manager?
- Have htmlManager and cssManager which make sure all assets are only loaded
once? --> Faster loading, centralized resource loading
- Make automatically-loading-upon-scrolling-divs into widgets?
- Make data-manager-modules into subclasses and gather similar code
  - Especially if static variables become implemented (or Typescript is used)!
- Split widgets into components specific to Acnicoy and base-widgets
  - Make base-widgets completely independent of Acnicoy (e.g. no base import)
- Make partitioned window stuff into class?
- Solve design dilemma concerning tabbed frame
  - Allow full styling of all frames while keeping it semantic
- Simply register event listeners in constructor after all?
- Use JS to position popup-panes and don't make it child of triggering button
- Hide all initially hidden things with javascript instead of CSS? Works?
- Organize each dataManager module into following scheme?
  1. Control functions (load, save, setLanguage)
  2. Functions completely independent of languages
  3. Functions operating on current language
  4. Functions depending on any other language (using `dataMap`)
- svg-bar-diagram: Pass in length-parameters as options to draw-function
- Make "events" and "main" globals attributes of "app" global
- Implement dynamic adding of tabs in tabbed-frame using `slotchange`-event
- Merge kanji and hanzi module into one, generalize with different readings
- Consider making shortcut-manager a data manager
  (-> if done, then remove separate init-call in data-manager.js)
- Using font-awesome font in some general widgets (e.g. tree-view), generalize
- Unify the fadeIn/fadeOut/slideToCurrentPosition functions
- Completely remove example-word-entry widget/template?
- Implement label-checkbox widget?
- Implement data binding function between checkboxes/radiobuttons and settings
- Only store number of items tested in stats (get added items from database)?
  - Necessary to build an index in the userdata database on time added?
- Further refactor Application framework
  - Implement quit-function of Application class, move controlled closing there
- Decide whether kanji search should be additive. If so, merge it into the
  dictionary search function
- As soon as everything search-related is generalized, the objects passed to
  the view in the dictionary can be a single parameterized obj
- Switch to "better-sqlite3" to increase performance and code style?
- Removing word from vocabulary lists should be done in datamanager function too
- Content-related tables should be created dynamically when the content is first
  loaded instead of at creation-time of the database!
- Python's built in xml module (with the ElementTree class) has no feature to
  disable entity expansion - use lxml instead to keep dictionary tag names.
- Remove font-awesome from github repo and add as node package instead

### Changes
- Don't assign font family for every element and let it be inherited instead
- Use `position: sticky` for kanji info panel in kanji section?
- use split function from sqlite instead of JS version?
- Use ruby annotations for furigana
- Allow adding text to checkbox in a slot after a margin
- Use CSS counters where necessary (Especially srs-schemes-overlay)
- Extend markdown-js to suit the purpose of the program
  - See Japanese stack exchange for furigana syntax
  - Provide easy way create kanji-links (or just scan through markdown)
- Identify SRS schemes by ID instead of name!
- Use advanced CSS width values where possible (`width: fill`);
- Replace inputs in srs-schemes-overlay with content-editable attribute
- Use events to communicate changes between panel and suggestion pane?
- Use String.matchAll for test comparisons (now that Electron has Chrome 73+)
