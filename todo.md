- Adjust scrollbars to corresponding background color so that they're always
  visible well. Also consider using thin, rounded scrollbars with margin
- Improve policy for incorrectly answered SRS items
  - Don't always move down two levels, but one with adjusted review time instead

- Adjust kanji-section (and create hanzi-section) to be available as limited
  version even when no language content is installed (and display notice that
  language content can be installed to see more).

### Performance
- Things got slower when reworking sass? Maybe because main window is flex now?
  Replace with `calc(100% - x)` or `width: fill`?

  - Drill cursor for large achievement (e.g. 1000 kanji)
  - Tamamo's fluffy tail cursor for larger achievement (e.g. 600 kanji)
  - Yona's hairpin cursor for medium achievement (e.g. 300 kanji)
  - Meliodas' dragon handle for small achievement (e.g. 150 kanji)
- Seperate whole framework into an own NPM package
- Allow converting parts of vocabulary into html/pdf/markdown file
  - Use electrons builtin for pdf (And a fitting media stylesheet?)
- Correctly assign furigana
- Restructuring: Separate core functionality from language extensions
  - Provide interface for extensions, e.g.:
    - `addMenuButton(label, callback)` for main-section extensions
    - `addStatistic(element)` for stats-section extensions
  - Use ES6 proxies for data modules
  - Split data generation from makefile into one for each language,
  along with the py script to generate it
- Consider making kanji-modes into single one with 2-3 parts for each kanji
  - Very problematic for partly added kanji
  - Would allow more stylish and compact mode presentation
  - Would allow easier importing from Houhou SRS
- Find monolingual dictionary for Japanese
- Add additional field to kanjiData database for "hidden acceptable meanings",
  containg synonyms or words with very similar meaning?

- Extend vocabulary section to allowing viewing detailed list of vocab items
- Split kanji meanings into groups too?
  - Adjust kanji info panel and suggestion windows for kanji panels
- Migrate to Typescript (And offer interfaces for language extensions)?
- How to handle overtime due of SRS items? E.g. if an item has been scheduled
  for after a day, but has been answered correctly after 1 month - should the
  item be moved to 2 days, or directly to 2 months?
  -> Disambiguate between *frequent practice* and *long memorization time*
  -> Make test-settings for handling these according to preferences
- Add new database columns for non-outdated/non-rare on-/kun-yomi
- Allow having different SRS schemes for each test-mode

    - Button to start download and link to settings (and progress bar?)
  - Achievement earned
  - Download finished
- Small icon in each notification to remove it
- "Clear all" functionality
- Accessable from top right corner of the window?
- Shortly light up with an animation if there's a new notification
  - Keep faintly glowing until notification is read
  - Highlight unread notifications
- Store in a new file in user data

### Content section
- Create similar kanji/word disambiguation pages of the following form:
  - [Optional] Title

  - List of separate elucidations (info for each kanji/word)
    - [Optional, for kanji] Some example words to see the differences clearly
  - [Optional] Supplementary information (Joint disambiguation, or notes)
  - [Optional] Sources
- Contains a database of custom info cards
- Allow uploading and sharing vocabulary lists
- Offer small coding environment for creating cards with extended markdown
- Link to here for each kanji detail in info panel (like country/measure/number)

Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Naming
- Rename panels into "panes" or "sliding-panes"?
- Use folder "widgets" only for base widgets, put everything else directly into
  a folder called "gui-components"
  - Adjust pathManager and index.js
- Rename "Windows" to "Screens"?

### Refactoring
- Move stuff in settings subsections into a settings manager?
- Have htmlManager and cssManager which make sure all assets are only loaded
once? --> Faster loading, centralized resource loading
- Make automatically-loading-upon-scrolling-divs into widgets?
- Make data-manager-modules into subclasses and gather similar code
  - Especially if static variables become implemented (or Typescript is used)!
- Split widgets into components specific to Acnicoy and base-widgets
  - Make base-widgets completely independent of Acnicoy (e.g. no base import)
- Make partitioned window stuff into class?
- Solve design dilemma concerning tabbed frame
  - Allow full styling of all frames while keeping it semantic
- Simply register event listeners in constructor after all?
- Use JS to position popup-panes and don't make it child of triggering button
- Hide all initially hidden things with javascript instead of CSS? Works?
- Organize each dataManager module into following scheme?
  1. Control functions (load, save, setLanguage)
  2. Functions completely independent of languages
  3. Functions operating on current language
  4. Functions depending on any other language (using `dataMap`)
- svg-bar-diagram: Pass in length-parameters as options to draw-function
- Make "events" and "main" globals attributes of "app" global
- Implement dynamic adding of tabs in tabbed-frame using `slotchange`-event
- Merge kanji and hanzi module into one, generalize with different readings

### Adaptions
- Don't assign font family for every element and let it be inherited instead
- Use `position: sticky` for kanji info panel in kanji section?
- use split function from sqlite instead of JS version?
- Use ruby annotations for furigana
- Allow adding text to checkbox in a slot after a margin
- Use CSS counters where necessary (Especially srs-schemes-overlay)
- Extend markdown-js to suit the purpose of the program
  - See Japanese stack exchange for furigana syntax
  - Provide easy way create kanji-links (or just scan through markdown)
- Identify SRS schemes by ID instead of name!
- Use advanced CSS width values where possible (`width: fill`);
